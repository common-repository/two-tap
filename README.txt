**Want to augment your existing product inventory or build an profitable dropshipping business?**

1. Easy! Safe! Fast!

== Features ==

= One-click product import =
Feel free to browse our 1 million+ products catalog with the help of our advanced filtering system. Once you settle on a product you can **import it with literally one click**.

= Easily customize imported products =

Imported products can be easily customized as regular store products. You can even set custom information or markup rules.

= Real-time price & inventory updates =

Before any order, the price & availability information is being refreshed in real-time. Also the plugin automatically refreshes the product data (title, description, prices, availability, images, etc.) daily in the background.

= Automatic order placement =

Only after the customer places an order on your WooCommerce store using your regular payment methods, the plugin automatically makes the purchase with Two Tap using your deposit.

= Product categorization =

Two Tap products are automatically sorted into categories.

= Real-time alerts =

The plugins let's you know if you have unfulfilled orders or insufficient funds to place an order.


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 5.6
* MySQL 5.6
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* WooCommerce 3.0

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Two Tap, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type Two Tap and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Upload `two-tap` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Import US products to your regular WooCommerce from the `Two Tap` menu in wp-admin
1. Set your markup
1. Start selling


= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [Two Tap Community Forum](http://community.twotap.com/) or join us on our [Slack Community channel](https://ttdropship.herokuapp.com/).
Also you can shoot us an e-mail at [support@twotap.com](mailto:support@twotap.com).

= Will customers place orders for products just like any other WooCommerce item in your inventory =

Yes! They wouldn't notice the difference.

= What is Two Tap? =

Two Tap connects US Retailers to companies that want to sell their products, in apps or sites, domestic or internationally.

= What makes Two Tap unique? =

Two Tap's technology allows US retailers to be part of the program without having to do any kind of integration work on their end. Meaning, thousands of US retailers will be supported soon.

= Are all retailers enabled for Dropshipping? =

About 150+ stores out of Two Tap's thousands of supported retailers have been enabled up until now.

= How much does it cost? =

Contact us for a quote. One thing to note, if you are using your own crossborder logistrics, Two Tap will split the affiliate commission with you, meaning Two Tap will pay you.

= Can you add my favorite US retailer? =

Yes, we add new stores all the time. [Contact us](mailto:support@twotap.com).

= Is markup allowed on products? =

Yes, you can add your own pricing for any product.

= What about affiliate commissions? =

With domestic orders Two Tap will refund 50% of the affiliate commission to your Two Tap account for future orders.

The affiliate commission varies based on the type of products and brand/retailer. International orders don't have any refunds.

= Who handles payments? =

Customers place orders through your regular WooCommerce setup. Meaning, they will pay using the payment methods you have set up and the money goes to you.
Two Tap buys products from suppliers using funds you deposit to your Two Tap account. Only after the customer order is placed will Two Tap go and acquire the products.

= What countries are supported? =

Products can be sent to US addresses (and US fulfilment centers for CrossBorder shipping). **In the next couple of months we plan on introducing seamless end to end shipping to a large number of countries**.

= What is Dropshipping? =

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product.
The biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail model is that the selling merchant doesn't stock or own inventory. Instead, the merchant purchases inventory as needed from a third party – usually a wholesaler or manufacturer – to fulfill orders.

= What is Wholesale? =

Wholesale is the resale of new and used goods in large quantities and at low prices, typically to be sold on by retailers at a profit. The big risk involved with wholesale is that there's no guarantee that you will sell the products. Also frequently you will need to physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute products in smaller lots.
